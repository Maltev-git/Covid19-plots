    "The growth is no longer exponential in some regions but rather linear. It appears that the implemented measures decrease the infection rate. The fit curves are based on the current data, so they are estimates for an unchanged situation. Update 2020-04-02: Now, the current fit curves are based on data from the last two weeks.\n",
